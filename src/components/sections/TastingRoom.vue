            Our brewery has a bright and family-friendly tasting room, a retail area and small patio, open 6 days a week
            and located next to the Safeway on Railway Avenue.
          </p>
          <p class="py-2">
            In addition to our usual line up of beers, we also serve seasonal brews, pilot brews (our brewerâ€™s latest
            small batch creations), and our brand new Beer Cocktails. Juice and San Pellegrino are in the self-serve
            case for designated drivers and youngsters.
          </p>
          <p class="py-2">
            The retail area carries Canmore Brewing branded road cycling kit, mountain bike jerseys, an assortment of
            tee shirts and flannels, hats, buffs, glassware and a rotating inventory of fun socks and novelty items.
            Perfect as souvenirs or gifts for your beer-loving friends and family. Everyone looks great in orange!
