Traversing the slopes of the *Ehagay Nakoda Range* from the base of the *Three Sisters* to the shadow of *Ha Ling Peak*, it has something for everyone!\n\nThis lagered blonde was made to be a favourite for as long as the trail has been. Light in body and colour, with hints of stone fruit and grain."

The trains still rumble by our door a few times a day.\n\nThis refreshing and crisp west coast style IPA has a healthy dose of malted rye, plenty of hops in the boil and a thorough dry hop. This IPA is very approachable."

Follow the Georgetown Trail and see for yourself.\n\nWith the addition of caramel and chocolate malts, this brown ale will entice you over to the dark side – in a good way! Crisp, sweet and soooooo caramello."

It all started in 1887 with the No. 1 Mine at Canmore Creek.\n\nSilky smooth and dark, just like the area’s coal. This English style stout features pale, chocolate and caramel malts along with roasted and flaked barley for a complex, delicious treat."

Some folks stay for a beer and have some fun - that's us.\n\nThis New England style IPA is hazy, fruity, and just the right beer to embrace the Fall with. Lots of aroma and flavour are provided by Hallertau Blanc, Mosaic, and Amarillo hops."

The addition of Sabro hops makes the magic complete - giving us the incredibly juicy Phuzzy Peach Sour."
